# Bat-Ball-Tracking-System

This repository contains my work on developing Bat and Ball Tracker. This is inspired from one of the [Dockship Challenge](http://dockship.io/challenges/60f5a5ae7b01760c32a439f7/ball-&-bat-tracking-hiring-challenge/overview). The aim of the challenge was to build Bat and Ball tracking AI system using International Cricket dataset. 

The dataset conatins 824 png images along with annotations in bat_ball.csv for training the model. And test set comprises of 7 mp4 videos to validate performance of model in real time
